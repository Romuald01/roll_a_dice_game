2. then the number of the dice rolled will be added to the current score.
3. if the active player 1 roll a dice and is equal to 1, then the player will be switched to player 2 and vice versa.
4. when you click on the hold button your current score will be added to your score.
5. if your score is greater than or equal to 20, you have won the game. then a background will show you won the game,
6. then none of the button works when a player wins.
